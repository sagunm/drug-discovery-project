# drug-discovery-project


* **Data** - The ChEMBL database was used to procure the data needed for this project. The database consists of curated bioactivity data of more than 2 million compounds.

* **Tools** - The tools used were pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn.

* **Models** - A Random Forest Regression model was used to predict the pIC50 values of compounds. The pIC50 value indicates the 'druglikeness' of a compound or how much of the drug (compound) is needed to inhibit a biological process by half. Then, LazyRegressor was also used to compare various regression models to find which is the best fit.


*Most of the information about drug discovery theory that I studied to build this specialized model was gained from Data Professor's youtube videos.
